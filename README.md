# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts Project

## Overview

This project involved building a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using HTML and CSS. The objective was to create a folder structure, an HTML file, and a CSS file. Additionally, specific images were required to be included in the project.

## Learning Pointers

### 1. Folder Structure

Maintaining a logical folder structure is crucial for organizing project files. I learned to structure my project with separate folders for images, CSS, and HTML files.

### 2. HTML and CSS Files

Creating an HTML file involved structuring the content, linking stylesheets, and adding images. CSS was used for styling, and I learned to link it correctly to the HTML file.

### 3. Overcoming Difficulties

#### a. Recalling Selectors and Concepts
- I encountered difficulties recalling concepts like ID selectors, padding, margin, and display properties. To overcome this:
  - **Chrome Dev Tools:** Used Chrome Dev Tools to inspect elements on websites, helping me understand how different styles were applied.
  - **Practice:** Implemented concepts in my own code on a local server to reinforce learning.
  - **Testing and Experimentation**: Used Chrome Dev Tools to experiment with different attribute values. Testing variations in my own code helped solidify my understanding and troubleshoot any issues.
    
#### b. Relative File Paths for images
- The other challenge I encountered was determining the correct relative file path for images to ensure they were displayed properly on the website. To overcome this:
  - **Understanding Directory Structure:** Carefully analyzed the project's folder structure to determine the relative paths from the HTML file to the image files.
  - **Trial and Error:** Utilized trial and error to test different relative paths, ensuring images were correctly linked. This iterative process helped me grasp the concept of relative paths effectively.
  - **Browser Console:** Leveraged the browser console to identify any errors in image loading, allowing for quick adjustments to the file paths.
  - **Forums and Communities:** Engaged in online forums and communities to seek assistance when facing challenges. Received valuable insights and solutions from the community.

## Conclusion
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of HTML and CSS, and the challenges I faced enhanced my problem-solving skills. Regular practice and utilizing tools like Chrome Dev Tools proved instrumental in overcoming difficulties.
Collaboration and utilizing online resources played a crucial role in overcoming hurdles and broadening my knowledge in web development.
